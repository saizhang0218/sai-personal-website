I am a doctoral student of Computer Science at Harvard University. Before coming to Harvard, I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Statistics from University of Toronto. My research interest lies in software/hardware codesign for efficient deep neural network (DNN) implementation on hardware platforms. I am also interested in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and its application.
